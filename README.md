Detecting railway track faults through deep learning 

Railway track fault detection is a classification problem which
aims to classify defective and non defective railway tracks. nowadays,
railway maintenance is still done manually in countries like India.
This is time consuming, unsafe and unreliable. There is a call for
automation and thus a lot of recent work has been on creating deep
learning methods to classify faulty railway tracks. In this study a
small data set with a lot of variation is used. This data originates
from railway tracks in Bangladesh, India. Three deep learning architectures will be used to classify the data: InceptionV3, ResNet50V2
and EfficientNetB7. In addition to this a segmentation method (canny
edge detection) is used to investigate the usefulness of segmentation
before feeding the images into a deep learning algorithm. The main
results of this study showed that the EfficientNetB7 architecture had
the highest accuracy. The algorithms which were fed with the segmented images saw an increase in correctly predicting faulty railways.
However, the overall accuracy did not improve. Limitations as well
as suggestions will be discussed for further research.
